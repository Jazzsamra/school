                    <p>
                        The Curriculum at The Unirise World School is a unique amalgamation of education theories and
                        practices from India and abroad. We encourage a firm traditional and cultural base in our
                        curriculum to ensure a sense of identity and ethics in student. With international boundaries
                        shrinking, fast growing communication technology, world economy and business process outsourcing
                        - global acceptance of Indian economical and intellectual growth has opened a huge challenge to
                        our education system. We cannot limit our kids to old educational structure anymore.


                        The Unirise World School <strong> follows the curriculum specified by Central Board of Secondary
                            Education (C.B.S.E)</strong> for the course content and modifies the same by creative and
                        innovative
                        learning methodologies backed by some of the well accepted content makers and providers around
                        the globe. We intend to hone the inherent skills and personalities of the children and make them
                        globally competitive without burdening their frail, innocent minds.


                        We at The Unirise World School believe that good portion of the learning happens through
                        experiential and exploratory learning, ample opportunities and tools are provided to the
                        students for the same for him to become a thinker and a logical questioner.


                        The School shall also keep a focus on strong academic rigor to also enable the students to get
                        admissions into the best institutes in India and abroad to pursue their career goals and dreams.
