                        Greetings
                        <br>
                        Education and health are the two basic facilities; rather these are the fundamental rights of
                        the society. Without them the holistic development of our society is not possible. If I am to
                        say that education is above the two, it would not be an over statement. A well educated person
                        gets the inspiration and the mental stability to grow and expand his visions. It is the
                        education which enhances a person's ability to think and dream high. They are trained and<span

                            groomed to differentiate between the right and the wrong, with the help of which they are
                            able
                            to excel in their social, economic, legal, religious and domestic responsibilities. Since a
                            very
                            long time I had this thought in mind to provide quality education to the children of this
                            region. God has been kind to fulfill my desire and has blessed me to be able to do my bit
                            for
                            the noble cause of education. Nothing in this world is complete without the blessing of
                            parents,
                            with the blessings of my late father Sh. Jawahar Lal Aggarwal and my mother Smt. Sheela
                            Rani, I
                            have taken up this task to establish a school, The Unirise World School, which I believe
                            should
                            prove to be part of my social, moral and ethical responsibility towards the society. With
                            this
                            small step I believe we would be able to fulfill the dream of the father of our nation

                        Dear Friends,
                        Greetings
                        <br>
                        I am very happy to see the school taking the shape in the right direction in the vision set by
                        our founder chairman. The Unirise World School in many ways is going to be a different school
                        with a different line of thought. This difference will make a strong impact on the academic
                        understanding and holistic development of children.
                        Through Our personal interaction with some of the global educationists, veterans in the fields
                        of Arts, Dance, Music & Sports, We have designed the academic process and curriculum along with

                        <span id="threedots">...</span>
                        <span id="threemore" style="display:none !important;">
                            Pedagogy for the students to excel in their individual strengths. Choosing a school, such as
                            The
                            Unirise World School, not only gives the students the benefits of an Indian education, but
                            the
                            qualification gained and global knowledge acquired and highly transferable. The structure
                            and
                            consistency of curriculum allows students to easily move.
                            We have tried to incorporate the best practices from the field of Primary Education from
                            around
                            the world through our research and personal experience across the globe. The focus area is
                            to
                            emphasize on the importance of Academics, Spoken English and overall personality development
                            of
                            child with wide array of co-curricular and sports activities with a large number of
                            facilities
                            and exciting activities planned in the upcoming session, it shall sure be a great learning
                            experience of all students here.
                            Wish you all a Happy Learning.

                        The opportunity to shape the minds and lives of young children and providing them with means of
                        attaining knowledge is a divine blessing and we are fortunate to have been ordained with it.
                        A learning community does not just happen; it is created intentionally at every level of school
                        or an organization. At The Unirise World School, we employ several strategies to create this
                        type of environment.These teaching and learning strategies are most successful when they are
                        implemented in a system, such as ours, that encourages collaboration among staff and student,
                        and in which each is a part of a well-planned ‘whole’.
                        <span id="lastdots">...</span>
                        <span id="lastmore" style="display:none !important;">
                            It is also certain that these strategies
                            are most effective when they are applied in positive, supportive environments where there is
                            recognition of the emotional, social and physical needs of students and where individual
                            strengths are recognized, nurtured and developed.
                            The whirl winds of change sow the seed of progress, especially so, in educational
                            institution
                            like The Unirise World School which is the virtual embryo for new ideas. In the present
                            scenario, an educated person is no longer just literate, but one who is willing to learn –
                            unlearn and relearn, the one who is ready to retrace the paths to unfold newer horizons. We
                            believe in a holistic approach focusing on the overall development of the child, who now
                            breathes free, exploring latest talents and is no longer dubbed as a failure. The path
                            breaking
                            ideas initiated by CBSE have been very illuminating. Whenever there is a drive for a change
                            in
                            education, reformers talk as though change in general were desirable and good. Those who
                            "resist
                            change"? are seen as impediments to reforms. Neither idealism nor materialism is sufficient
                            to
                            address the complexities of education. We must honour both permanence and flux.
                            Today education system has shed the dead and obsolete dimensions and opened itself to
                            include
                            all that it makes a child more responsible, sensitive and concerned global citizen.
                            I look forward to your support to make our dream become a reality.
                            At The Unirise world School, we want to instill an enthusiasm for lifelong learning in each
                            student along with the sklills necessary to prepare for the challenges and changes which
                            will be
                            faced in their future. I believe that our students must develop the skills and understanding
                            that will enable them to become reponsible, contributing citizens of the global community.
                            This
                            is all the vision that I’ m looking at currently, but it’s not possible without everyone’s
                            combined efforts. Your co-operation is what I’m looking at.?

                            <br>
                            Wish you all a very happy academic session.
